title: Reference in Brewing better coffee
description: notes extraction guide

Extracting the taste profile of coffee is always challenging, as beans vary, and a lot of experimentation is to be done to reach that "preferred" brew. I have always find this challenge and exciting and enjoyable process.  It's something that I'd like to better at, to improve my coffee experience.

I was told by a friend about this [coffee compass](https://www.baristahustle.com/blog/the-coffee-compass/), made by the people from Coffee Compass. It's a helpful tool for brewers to re-calibrate and adjust the brewing process. 



I hope you enjoy it!



Cheers,
