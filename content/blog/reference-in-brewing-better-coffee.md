title: Reference in Brewing better coffee
description: notes extraction guide
---
Extracting the taste profile of coffee is always challenging, as beans vary, and a lot of experimentation is to be done to reach that "preferred" brew. I have always find this challenge and exciting and enjoyable process.  It's something that I'd like to better at, to improve my coffee experience.

A friend shared to me a brewing guideline that helps brewers re-calibrate and adjust taste. It's called a [coffee compass](https://www.baristahustle.com/blog/the-coffee-compass/). It's a way to help brewers achieve the desired taste or profile. It also tells you if coffee was over or under extracted, and provides suggestions on how to adjust taste.

I hope you enjoy it!

Cheers,
