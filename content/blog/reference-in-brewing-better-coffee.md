Extracting the taste profile of coffee is always challenging, as beans vary, and a lot of experimentation is to be done to reach that "preferred" brew. I have always find this challenge and exciting and enjoyable process.  It's something that I'd like to better at, to improve my coffee experience.

A friend shared to me a brewing guideline that helps brewers re-calibrate and adjust taste. It's called a [coffee compass](https://www.baristahustle.com/blog/the-coffee-compass/). It's a way to help brewers achieve the desired taste or profile. It also tells you if coffee was over or under extracted. The guide provides suggestions on how to adjust taste by adjusting brew time, level of extraction, and water coffee ratio.

I hope you find it useful!

Cheers,
