Coffee grind size is an important parameter in brewing, it could cause over extraction or under extraction. Grind size varies depending on your brewing method, and also taste. 

I found a [website](https://honestcoffeeguide.com/guides/coffee-grind-size-chart/) that helps you find the right grind size for your grinder.
