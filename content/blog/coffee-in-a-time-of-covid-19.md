Manila is on lockdown, which means, a lot of businesses are closing down or are working in skeleton workforce. During this period, it's important to have your caffeine supplies filled and ready.

Thanks to the folks from [Home Brewers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/417230162264121/), it's now convenient to know all the available coffee bean sellers, including handy information like the payment methods, contact number, delivery options and beans. Do check the [list](https://bit.ly/coffeebeandealers?fbclid=IwAR3H0VrcGKc2la-xWPcIOWoNrSUcdrYqVMwdC4NJAD-juxe39fNYlOXsePs) out and let me know which beans you are eager to try next.

Stay safe!
